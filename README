ZeroRobotics 2011 CyberAvo 

C source codes submitted for the 2011 semifinals and finals of the 
ZeroRobotics competition (http://zerorobotics.mit.edu).
We managed to win both semifinals (worldwide competition) and finals (european
competition).

Despite of my attempts to comment the source code, it probably isn't as clear
as one should expect... Get over it :-)
